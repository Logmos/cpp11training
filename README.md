# cpp 11 training 

Exercises to train your C++11 (and then some).

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/xtofl/cpp11training/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/xtofl/cpp11training/latest)
:( Currently I don't get g++5 nor clang installed on drone.io - have to look for e.g. travis or some other ci.

## Getting started

### Linux

DISCLAIMER: the Linux build is currently a bit broken on `gtest`.  I want to fix it but haven't enough CMake knowledge.  I'm open for pull requests :)

On Linux all you need is

    # unless you're happy with g++ - the compile messages
    # can get quite cumbersome when dealing with templates
    export CXX=clang++

    git clone git@github.com:xtofl/cpp11training
    cd cpp11training/cpp11training
    mkdir Debug
    cd Debug
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
    make -j $(nproc)



### Windows

    
Prerequisite: currently I have it up and running for Visual Studio 2017 Community edition.  It relies on NuGet package manager, which should be installed explicitly (cf. (stackoverflow)[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42875451/cant-find-the-nuget-package-manager-in-visual-studio-2017])

Open the `cpp11training/cpp11training.sln` solution.


## Exercising

The project contains a bunch of failing unit tests.  The idea is that you un-DISABLE each one of them, and make it pass (using C++11, obviously).  (the gtest library by default ignores tests starting with `DISABLED_`.)

I tried to add a TODO: comment hinting what's expected from you to fulfill the exercise.

Once all tests pass, I have nothing more to teach you :)
